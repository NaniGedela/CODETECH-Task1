Overview of the project

Project: BMI Calculator App

Project Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator app is a user-friendly application designed to calculate 
and provide insights into a user’s BMI based on their height and weight. The app will allow 
users to input their height and weight in various units, such as metric (kilograms and meters)
and imperial (pounds and inches), and then calculate their BMI. Additionally, the app will 
categorize the BMI result into standard categories such as underweight, normal weight, 
overweight, and obesity, providing users with a better understanding of their health status.

Key Features:
User Input:

Accepts height and weight inputs in both metric and imperial units.
Validates user input to ensure correctness.
BMI Calculation:

Calculates BMI using the standard formula:
Metric: 
BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)^2
 
Result Display:

Shows the calculated BMI value.
Categorizes the BMI into standard ranges:
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
User Interface:
Clean, intuitive design for seamless user interaction.
Dropdown or toggle buttons for unit selection (metric/imperial).
Additional Features (optional):

Technology Stack:
Frontend: React Native for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android) or Flutter for a similar approach.
Backend (optional, for advanced features like user accounts and data storage): Node.js with a lightweight database like Firebase or SQLite.
Testing: Unit and UI testing using Jest, React Native Testing Library, or Flutter's testing tools.
Development Phases:
Phase 1: Planning & Design
  Define app layout and flow.
  Design mockups and wireframes.
Phase 2: Core Implementation
  Develop the BMI calculation logic.
  Create the user interface.
  Add input validation.
Phase 3: Feature Enhancements
  Integrate BMI categorization.
  Add optional features (e.g., history tracking).
Phase 4: Testing
  Conduct functional, UI, and user acceptance testing.
Phase 5: Deployment
Publish the app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

This app serves as a simple yet effective tool for individuals to monitor and understand their 
health metrics, making it ideal for personal use or as part of a broader health and wellness 
platform.
